Exercise 1:

Thoughts about exercise:
I enjoyed using Dillinger.io -- learning the markdown syntax wasn’t too challenging. I can see why it would be useful for
those working with text.  

Things that were hard/what I did:
My only challenge was that my images weren't displaying. Instead there was just a little box where it was supposed to be. This
is what I had written down:

![picture](https://www.pexels.com/photo/book-macbook-pro-working-studying-7354/ "Studying")

Thoughts on where to go next:
I'd like to work with markdown a bit more so I'm comfortable using it in the course.
I would also like to learn some html so I can have a website of my own one day.

Exercise 2:

Thoughts about the exercise:
Working with DH Box initially seemed intimidating but wasn’t too bad once I played around with it. 

Things that were hard/what I did:
I was having a bit of trouble opening the dhbox-work-today.md file for a while and received these messages:

ktamg2@1b6946be137d:~$ nano dhbox-work-today.md
-bash: nano: command not found

I read a bit further into the exercise description and realized I had to install the nano text editor.
I typed in “history” again to return to main directory, then retried the command to open the file, and it worked!

Thoughts on where to go next:
I was able to complete the exercise but I'll have to practice using this more to be fully comfortable.

------
Exercise 3:

Thoughts about the exercise:
Creating the repository was straightforward, and now I know how to push files to my Github which will be useful for this 
course, as well as other work I am undertaking.

Things that were hard/what I did:
I initially didn't understand what a "commit" was and had to read about it several times to understand.

------
Exercise 4:

Thoughts about the exercise:
This was really challenging and I’m not very sure what I’m doing. I’m wary of continuing on without understanding.

Things that were hard/what I did:
I did the git init and that wasn’t too bad, but I got stuck toward the end of “git status.” (at the step where it was supposed to display this)

On branch master
Initial commit
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   readme.md```

I received:

ktamg2@1b6946be137d:~/first-repo$ git status
On branch master
Initial commit
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        readme.md
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
ktamg2@1b6946be137d:~/first-repo$ git add <first-repo>
-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
ktamg2@1b6946be137d:~/first-repo$ git commit -m "My first commit"
On branch master
Initial commit
Untracked files: readme.md
nothing added to commit but untracked files present
ktamg2@1b6946be137d:~/first-repo$ 


I’m certain I did something horribly wrong, but I haven’t a clue where to begin. I feel as though this is the wall where 
I can’t continue anymore, despite wanting to. On a positive note, I’m glad that I was at least able to do the “git init” 
but if the rest of this exercise is something we’re expected to do regularly, I’ll be quite worried. I spent a good four 
hours redoing this exercise and haven’t received different results.

Thoughts on where to go from here:
I think I’ll probably have to put time aside to figure out how to use this. I would prefer to drag and drop files 
into Github because this is intimidating. I did feel like I went out of my comfort zone, so I hope to do that the next 
few weeks as well.
